                    I enjoy coding, so I am mostly interested in the programming aspect of game development."

                    "Hi everyone, I'm Sam! I'm a previous president of the club now working to improve and upkeep the club website! I initially got into game development due to my love of
                    video games (obviously), but it also incorporated my three biggest hobbies: art, music, and writing. I've been wanting to make video games since I was a kid, and now that I know
                    how to make them, I want to share the knowledge to anyone else who's interested in game development!"

                    After joining this club, I learned that game development is pretty fun and something that I enjoy! Thanks to this club, I’ve gained an interest in the coding aspect of game development."

                    "I’m Josh, this year’s club treasurer! I’ve been a Unity simp since middle school, and have been the proud creator of low-quality digital playthings for nearly a decade now (truly maidenless behavior). I like to dabble in all aspects of game dev, including art, music, animation, etc., but I’m most proficient in the programming side of things. As for why I’m interested in game dev, if there’s anything I love more than making games, it’s watching other people enjoy something I’ve made.
                    That’s why I hope to make it into the game industry professionally, so I can watch other people have fun with (or suffer through) whatever part I’ve been able to contribute to a project."

                    I may be more focused on the programming side, but I’m still trying to figure it out."

Then I played Fallout 4 for the first time and it was so cheeks that I became a writer out of sheer spite.
                    I'm  working on a few projects at the moment including our very own Planetary Pursuits, along with another project and scripts for plays that will come out at some point in the future. If you see me online feel free to ping me and tell me to stop rewriting the thing I'm writing right now."
