                    Hey everyone, I'm Sam! I immigrated from the Philippines in 2012 with my family to support my education. So far, I've gone from a McDonald's worker to a Cybersecurity intern. But for the most part, I'm interested in coding games! My game "Sol & Luna" won the Mentor's Award during the 2021 ArtCenter Game Jam, where I was both the game director and lead programmer. With my presidency, I hope to bring game development to all kinds of people.

                    Hey everybody, I'm Anthony Orellana but you can just call me Tony. I started game devevelopment in my second year at Cal Poly and fell in love immediately. I knew I had a passion for making games but didn't know it could be so easy. The Game Development Club gave me the opportunity, and I ran with it. I have been the lead on multiple projects of the club and plan to lead many more. I am currently the vice president and can't wait to help guide this club to new heights.

                    Hello! My name is Janista and I am hoping to go into game development after graduation. My favorite subjects tend to be mathematics or sciences and so I really enjoy coding! At the same time, I also really enjoy creative hobbies but drawing is the one that’s stuck with me the longest. When it comes to video games, RPGs and life simulators are the ones I tend to play the most, but I love all sorts of genres.

                    Summerville's research focuses on Games and Artificial Intelligence. This ranges from critical studies of games, to the algorithmic learning and creation of content for games, to the development of artificial intelligence techniques to enable new and creative game experiences.
