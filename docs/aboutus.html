                    I intend to pursue a career in the game development industry or work on small game development projects after graduation to fuse my
                    passion for 3D modeling and programming."

                    with the club, I have had so many great memories with everyone. I started with no knowledge of game dev in my second year, and it lead to
                    many crazy and insightful experiences from managing the club to doing a VR based senior project. Thank you to everyone for all the great

                    When it comes to video games, RPGs and life simulators are the ones I tend to play the most, but I love all sorts of genres.

                    What started off as a pursuit for an engineering degree had become four years, and counting, to acquire my bachelors degree in computer science.
                    I have contributed game pitches in the past to acquire experience in learning a new programming language, 3D modeling, wire framing, and sprite art.
                    As your webmaster, I expect a lot of adversity, but I also expect coming out of this with the necessary skills to contribute more passionately to future game pitches.
