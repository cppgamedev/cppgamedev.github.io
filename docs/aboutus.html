                    "Hello! I am Laurence, the President of GDC this year. When I'm not programming, I love 3D modeling in Blender and playing video games.
                    I intend to pursue a career in the game development industry or work on small game development projects after graduation to fuse my
                    passion for 3D modeling and programming."

                    with the club, I have had so many great memories with everyone. I started with no knowledge of game dev in my second year, and it lead to
                    many crazy and insightful experiences from managing the club to doing a VR based senior project. Thank you to everyone for all the great
                    fun that we've had and lets make this year even better!"
