            <h3>Q: When and where does the Game Development Club meet?</h3>
            <div class="card-ans">
                <p>
                    A: The club hosts its general meetings on Tuesdays at U-Hour (12:00pm - 12:50pm) and its workshops/game nights on Fridays at 5:00pm.
                    For general meetings, we meet in-person at Room 8-4 and online via our club Discord Server!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Q: Can I still join the club even if I have no experience in game development?</h3>
            <div class="card-ans">
                <p>
                    A: Of course! Anyone with any level of experience or skill is welcome at our club. Game design and development involves not just
                    programming but art, music, and writing as well!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Q: What projects does the club accomplish?</h3>
            <div class="card-ans">
                <p>
                    A: Every semester, the club hosts several game pitches where members present game concepts to one another. We then form teams of four or more and start working
                    on creating a minimum viable product of the game. Our goal is to have a working and playable game by the end of the semester!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Q: What is a "game pitch"?</h3>
            <div class="card-ans">
                <p>
                    A: A game pitch is a presentation of a game concept you want to start developing, with the purpose of gaining the interest of fellow game developers to join
                    your game development team!
                </p>
            </div>
