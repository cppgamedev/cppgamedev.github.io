# [Filterizr](http://yiotis.net/filterizr)
If you use Filterizr in your project and wish to get it featured on Filterizr's website, let me know!

## Description
Filterizr is a jQuery plugin that sorts, shuffles, searches and applies stunning filters over responsive galleries using CSS3 transitions. Write your very own, custom effects in CSS and watch your gallery come to life!

## Install
You can install Filterizr by downloading the minified version from its website or through NPM or Bower:
```
npm install filterizr
```
or
```
bower install filterizr
```

## Documentation & Tutorials
You can find Filterizr's documentation as well as a series of tutorials on how to install and operate Filterizr on [the Filterizr website](http://yiotis.net/filterizr).

## Why Filterizr?
There is a number of similar plugins some of which are very well-tested and feature-rich (such as Isotope, MixItUp etc). In my opinion the advantages of Filterizr is that despite its minute filesize (about 10.5kb), it comes with many features. It is very easy to use and setup, highly customizable and its performance is very fast and smooth (try it on mobile!).

## Browser support
IE10+ and all modern browsers.
