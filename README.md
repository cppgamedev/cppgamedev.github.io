# GDDC2.0
Redesigned Cal Poly Pomona's Game Development and Design Club Website

###### Photos Page
- Added the resources to sort out the photos whenever any of the photos is clicked using the LightBox library will bring up the photos as a modal window with scrolling.
- Photo filter UI, on the bottom of the page will arrange photos depending on what event the user would like to filter by. Selecting either one re-arranges the photos for that desired event photos.
- Clicking the `photo` icon will rearrange all the photos showing all photos
###### Events page
This page will display all the event titles and descriptions based on what type of event the club presented. Also the content inside of each event which can be reached by selecting the button can change to whatever desired such as videos, files for member to download such as tutorial files or just linking the user to other pages and content.
###### Index Page and Calendar setup
The calendar will be brought up in the form of a modal window. This is still being worked out on including the design and functionality.
###### Future Features
Still to be determined but we are considering a page for all of the club tutorials and resources all in one centralized location for members to access and download any files if necessary. This would be a great feature as it can contain all workshop videos in high quality recordings as well as documents and files linked to each repo for students to download and use.
###### Updated the Calendar feature on the index page
Found a neat little library to use for our calendar that displays current date, days with events and so much more. Event better works alongside Bootstrap and Jquery.
