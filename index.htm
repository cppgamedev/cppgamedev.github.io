            <p>
                We’re the Cal Poly Pomona Game Design and Development Club! A new club on campus focused on facilitating game development 
            and teamwork while providing a fun, educational, and social experience for members. We welcome students interested in different 
            aspects of game development whether it be creating art, writing stories, composing music, programming, business and marketing,
                or just playing games!
            <p>Interested in joining the club? Join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cppgamedev/">Facebook Group</a>.

        <h3>FAQ.</h3>
        <div class ="container">          
            <div class="question">
                <h5 class="faq-q">Is this club only for programmers?</h5>
                <p class="faq-a">Nope! It's open to all majors and skill levels. Games would be boring and incomplete without the teams of artists, writers, designers, and musicians! (Yes, even the playtesters)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h5 class="faq-q">Do I need any special skills to join?</h5>
                <p class="faq-a">Not at all! Even if you don't know the first thing about making games, as long as you're willing to learn (and nice!), you'll feel right at home.
                 We'll also provide some great workshops that you can attend. Or you can always just hang out and have fun!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h5 class="faq-q">Where does the club meet? (Fall 2014)</h5>
                <p class="faq-a">We currently meet during u-hour (12-12:50pm) in building 9-423 every other Tuesday starting on Oct 7. (Oct.7, Oct. 21, Nov. 4, Nov. 18, Dec. 2.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h5 class="faq-q">What kind of events do you host?</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li class="faq-a">Game Jams: We host a quarterly competition where people make games in accordance to a certain theme. We plan to do shorter, "hackathon-esque" jams in the future. </li>
                    <li class="faq-a">
                        Workshops: We try to help students every week by holding interactive workshops geared toward learning by doing.
                        These are mainly used to facilitate development of games for the quarterly game jams, and used as a workspace for people to work on their games.
